I've made some updates that seem pretty benign, by adding the [h-entry](https://indieweb.org/h-entry) and [h-card](https://indieweb.org/h-card) microformats to the site. I'm following instructions on [indieweb.org](https://indieweb.org) for starting up on what they call the "indie web." I'm not sure if the information is really relevant, though, I've never really heard many people talk about these microformats. But I figured if I learn how to add them now, it might save me headache if things ever get more complex, which I'm _really trying_ to prevent. Either way, I don't think it affects the performance or the overall "small web" vibe of the site too much, so I'll keep the formatting up. The only thing is that it "locks" me into this theme a little more, as I had to customize the theme by adding my own index.html and page.html templates. Not that I'm really locked in, I would just have to make changes to those files when I move over to a different theme. 

Can't really think of anything else to talk about here...I am working on a series of stories that I hope to be publishing here regularly. The only common link is that they have some randomness in them, in the form of some dice rolls in the following categories:

* type of protagonist: Hero, Anti-Hero, Villian Protagonist ([as discussed here](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/whats-the-difference-between-a-main-character-protagonist-and-hero))
* type of antagonist: Villain, Conflict-Creator, Inanimate Force, The protagonist ([as discussed here](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/the-main-types-of-antagonists))
* setting: Past, Present, Future

These are broad enough that I can still write about what I want to, but they narrow things down a bit so that I don't have to do all the "heavy lifting" in figuring out what to write. The hope is that this helps me actually write more.
