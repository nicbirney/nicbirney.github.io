Somewhere in the mountains,\
sometime in the nineties,\
preparing for Easter:\
my first memory.

You're in all those early ones:\
a soft ray of sunshine,\
providing me comfort,\
I have faith in you.

Please let me go back,\
please let me go back,\
I would give anything to go back

and spend more time with you,\
I'd spend all my time with you.

I woke up at midnight\
heard a voice from the phone:\
you and grandpa laughing.\
Some things never change.

Taking me back to bed,\
read me my favorite book.\
Precient in your way,\
simple yet profound.

"I'll love you forever\
I'll like you for always\
as long as I'm living\
my baby you'll be."

Please let me go back,\
please let me go back,\
I would give anything to go back

and spend more time with you,\
I'd spend all my time with you.
