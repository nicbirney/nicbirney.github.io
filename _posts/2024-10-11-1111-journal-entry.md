Phew! It's been a while! I'm starting the blog back up, I'm sure that's a relief
to _all the people_ who read it (nobody). 

I did end up switching to Jekyll, and I'm using Github Pages. It's just simpler,
I don't have to worry about hosting it myself, etc.

Setting up was a lot more complicated than I was thinking, but I did end up
finding an incredible theme in the form of
[Persephone](https://github.com/erlzhang/jekyll-theme-persephone). It's exactly
what I wanted: clean, simple, elegant, minimal. 

I just noticed that it's been almost exactly a year since I last used this
blog. I wonder if there's something about the fall that makes me want to do
this.

Quick recap of my life since I last was here:
- Got a new job as a Sr. Software Support Specialist 👷
- Lost a few pounds (yay!) ⚖
- Lost Licorice, our 18-year old pomeranian 😢
- Got a new puppy, who we are currently training! 🐶
- Some biiiig changes in my personal life that I don't want to go into too
much 🤫

But back on the puppy! Her name is Xochitl and she is FREAKING ADORABLE. Just look!

She's amazing and I love her. BUT it has been super stressful as well, to be
completely honest. Especially when we first got her, because she had a broken
paw and the vet told her we probably wouldn't be able to keep her because of her
breed (the vet incorrectly said that she was a Belgian Malinois). We got an
Embark test, and sure enough, she's a regular ol' pit-mix mutt! She's awesome,
pretty high energy but amazing.

OKbyyyeeee.
